# veteran_v1.0

Now a days people also understood that using strong and lengthy passwords will save them from being a victim :P
<br/>
Attacker has a choice to bruteforce but for that one should have a wordlist. It would be difficult for an attacker to first make a wordlist and then start bruteforce.
<br>So <b>Veteran</b> helps you to create wordlist.

# Requirements
One should have Python 2.x installed.
<br>If you are a windows user and you don't have python installed then you can <i>.exe</i> file

# How to use
<ol type=1>
<li>Start "Veteran"</li>
<li>Enter minimum length of character of the password</li>
<li>Enter maximum length of character of the password</li>
<li>Enter number of words to generate</li>
</ol>
<br>Your worlist is generated and stored in "<b>Wlist.txt</b>"
